It remained in the Top 75 for 29 weeks after its first release and three weeks more after two re-releases and sold well enough to be certified as double-platinum.

The Teletubbies have not had another such hit, making them a one-hit wonder. The song also reached #13 in The Netherlands, remaining in the Dutch Singles Chart for 13 weeks.

- Title: Baa, Baa, Black Sheep
""Baa, Baa, Black Sheep"" is an English nursery rhyme, the earliest surviving version of which dates from 1731. The words have not changed very much in two and a half centuries. It is sung to a variant of the 1761 French melody ""Ah! vous dirai-je, maman"". Uncorroborated theories have been advanced to explain the meaning of the rhyme. These include that it is a complaint against Medieval English taxes on wool and that it is about the slave trade. In the twentieth century it was a subject of controversies in debates about political correctness. It has been used in literature and popular culture as a metaphor and allusion. The Roud Folk Song Index classifies the lyrics and their variations as number 4439.

In the twentieth century it was a subject of controversies in debates about political correctness. It has been used in literature and popular culture as a metaphor and allusion.

The Battle of Sio, fought between December 1943 and March 1944, was the break-out and pursuit phase of General Douglas MacArthur's Huon Peninsula campaign, part of the New Guinea campaign of World War II. After the defeat of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg, Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese positions around Finschhafen. Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse, resulting in disease, malnutrition, and privation for the Japanese soldiers.

He performed the first artificially induced nuclear reaction in 1917 in experiments where nitrogen nuclei were bombarded with alpha particles.

- Title: Dicer
Insects can use Dicer as a potent antiviral. This finding is especially significant given that mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of many viral diseases including the potentially deadly arboviruses: West Nile virus, dengue fever and yellow fever. While mosquitoes, more specifically the ""Aedes aegypti"" species, serve as the vectors for these viruses, they are not the intended host of the virus. Transmission occurs as a result of the female mosquito's need for vertebrate blood to develop her eggs. The RNAi pathway in insects is very similar to that of other animals; Dicer-2 cleaves viral RNA and loads it onto the RISC complex where one strand serves as a template for the production of RNAi products and the other is degraded.

The affected kidney could then develop hydronephrosis, should a part of the kidney become swollen due to blocked flow of urine. It is classically described that there are three sites in the ureter where a kidney stone will commonly become stuck: where the ureter meets the renal pelvis; where the iliac blood vessels cross the ureters; and where the ureters enter the urinary bladder, however a retrospective case study, which is a primary source, of where stones lodged based on medical imaging did not show many stones at the place where the iliac blood vessels cross.

The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.

- Title: Civil union
A civil union (also known as a civil partnership) is a legally recognized arrangement similar to marriage, created primarily as a means to provide recognition in law for same-sex couples. Civil unions grant most or all of the rights of marriage except the title itself. Around the world, developed democracies began establishing civil unions in the late 1990s, often developing them from less formal domestic partnerships, which grant only some of the rights of marriage. In the majority of countries that established these unions in laws, they have since been either supplemented or replaced by same-sex marriage. Civil unions are viewed by LGBT rights campaigners as a ""first step"" towards establishing same-sex marriage, as civil unions are viewed by supporters of LGBT rights as a ""separate but equal"" or ""second class"" status.

Mitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 μm² in area but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth.

For some decades after his retirement, Merrill returned to the school once a year to give a speech on a topic of his choice, and his books are on display in the school library alongside those of Commonwealth alumni. Merrill insisted that the school has only one rule: ""No rollerskating in the halls,""—an exhortation that students should not ""...act like a damn fool, but think about your actions and how they affect others."" Merrill retired in 1981, and his memoir of the first 23 years of the school's history and his experience as headmaster, ""The Walled Garden"", was published the following year.

Rutherford moved in 1907 to the Victoria University of Manchester (today University of Manchester) in the UK, where he and Thomas Royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei. Rutherford performed his most famous work after he became a Nobel laureate. In 1911, although he could not prove that it was positive or negative, he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus, and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. He performed the first artificially induced nuclear reaction in 1917 in experiments where nitrogen nuclei were bombarded with alpha particles.

- Title: Dicer
Insects can use Dicer as a potent antiviral. This finding is especially significant given that mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of many viral diseases including the potentially deadly arboviruses: West Nile virus, dengue fever and yellow fever. While mosquitoes, more specifically the ""Aedes aegypti"" species, serve as the vectors for these viruses, they are not the intended host of the virus. Transmission occurs as a result of the female mosquito's need for vertebrate blood to develop her eggs. The RNAi pathway in insects is very similar to that of other animals; Dicer-2 cleaves viral RNA and loads it onto the RISC complex where one strand serves as a template for the production of RNAi products and the other is degraded.

- Title: John R. Sinnock
Upon the initial minting of the Roosevelt dime in 1946, a false narrative arose in the United States that the letters ""JS"" actually stood not for John Sinnock, but for Joseph Stalin. The urban folk story coincided with the Second Red Scare. The rumor surfaced again after the release of the Sinnock designed Franklin half dollar in 1948. Another controversy that surrounded the Roosevelt dime following its public release was an allegation that Sinnock copied or borrowed the design of the President's profile from a bronze bas relief created by sculptress Selma H. Burke for the dime's obverse. Sinnock denied this claim and said that the obverse portrait of the President was a composite of two studies which he made from life in 1933 and 1934.

The United Fruit Company had lobbied intensively for the overthrow because land reform initiated by Árbenz threatened its economic interests. The US also feared that the government of Árbenz was being influenced by communists. The coup attempt was planned with the support of the United Fruit Company, and of Anastasio Somoza García, Rafael Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the US-backed right-wing dictators of Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela respectively, who felt threatened by the democratic Guatemalan Revolution, and had sought to undermine it.

- Title: Battle of Sio
The Battle of Sio, fought between December 1943 and March 1944, was the break-out and pursuit phase of General Douglas MacArthur's Huon Peninsula campaign, part of the New Guinea campaign of World War II. After the defeat of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg, Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese positions around Finschhafen. Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse, resulting in disease, malnutrition, and privation for the Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.

A civil union (also known as a civil partnership) is a legally recognized arrangement similar to marriage, created primarily as a means to provide recognition in law for same-sex couples.

Insects can use Dicer as a potent antiviral. This finding is especially significant given that mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of many viral diseases including the potentially deadly arboviruses: West Nile virus, dengue fever and yellow fever. While mosquitoes, more specifically the ""Aedes aegypti"" species, serve as the vectors for these viruses, they are not the intended host of the virus. Transmission occurs as a result of the female mosquito's need for vertebrate blood to develop her eggs. The RNAi pathway in insects is very similar to that of other animals; Dicer-2 cleaves viral RNA and loads it onto the RISC complex where one strand serves as a template for the production of RNAi products and the other is degraded.

- Title: Intramuscular injection
In some populations, a change in injection site, needle length, or technique is necessary. For example, in very young people or frail elderly people, a normal length needle may be too long to safely inject in the desired muscle. For this reason, in these people, a shorter needle is recommended to decrease the risk of injecting too deep. It is also recommended to consider using the anterolateral thigh as an injection site in infants under one year old. To help infants and children cooperate with injection administration, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in the United States recommends using distractions, giving something sweet, and slow lateral swaying.

He was proud of ridding himself of ""the Puritanism in which I was bred"". His fondness for fine wines and spirits, which began at this period, eventually earned him the sobriquet ""Squiffy"". Returning to Oxford, Asquith spent the first year of his seven-year fellowship in residence there.

A kidney stone can move from the kidney and become lodged inside the ureter, which can block the flow of urine, as well as cause a sharp cramp in the back, side, or lower abdomen.

A civil union (also known as a civil partnership) is a legally recognized arrangement similar to marriage, created primarily as a means to provide recognition in law for same-sex couples. Civil unions grant most or all of the rights of marriage except the title itself. Around the world, developed democracies began establishing civil unions in the late 1990s, often developing them from less formal domestic partnerships, which grant only some of the rights of marriage. In the majority of countries that established these unions in laws, they have since been either supplemented or replaced by same-sex marriage. Civil unions are viewed by LGBT rights campaigners as a ""first step"" towards establishing same-sex marriage, as civil unions are viewed by supporters of LGBT rights as a ""separate but equal"" or ""second class"" status.

I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the eighth studio album by the American indie rock band Yo La Tengo, released on April 22, 1997, by Matador Records. It was produced by Roger Moutenot and recorded at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee. The album expands the guitar-based pop of its predecessor ""Electr-O-Pura"" to encompass a variety of other music genres, including bossa nova, krautrock, and electronic music. Most of the songs on the album deal with melancholy emotions and range from short and fragile ballads to long and open-ended dissonance. Upon release, ""Beating as One"" reached number 19 on the ""Billboard""s Heatseekers Albums chart, becoming the first Yo La Tengo album to enter the charts.

The ICRC has three official languages: English, French, and Spanish. Its official symbol is the Red Cross on a white background with the words ""COMITE INTERNATIONAL GENEVE"" circling the cross. The ICRC is known for its neutrality and impartiality, and it works in over 80 countries around the world to provide aid and support to people affected by conflict, natural disasters, and other crises.
In 2010, the ICRC played a crucial role in responding to the earthquake in Haiti, providing emergency aid and support to those affected. The ICRC also works to raise funds for its humanitarian activities through donations, including an annual ""Headquarters Appeal"" to cover its internal costs and ""Emergency Appeals"" for its individual missions.
The ICRC has a long history of providing aid and support to victims of conflict and natural disasters, including during World War II. In 1995, the ICRC President, Cornelio Sommaruga, publicly regretted the past mistakes and shortcomings of the Red Cross with regard to the victims of the concentration camps during the Holocaust.

- Title: Dicer
Insects can use Dicer as a potent antiviral. This finding is especially significant given that mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of many viral diseases including the potentially deadly arboviruses: West Nile virus, dengue fever and yellow fever. While mosquitoes, more specifically the ""Aedes aegypti"" species, serve as the vectors for these viruses, they are not the intended host of the virus. Transmission occurs as a result of the female mosquito's need for vertebrate blood to develop her eggs. The RNAi pathway in insects is very similar to that of other animals; Dicer-2 cleaves viral RNA and loads it onto the RISC complex where one strand serves as a template for the production of RNAi products and the other is degraded.

Swift's music consists primarily of elements of pop, synth-pop, country, country pop and rock. Her later works draw from genres such as indie folk, alternative rock, R&B, EDM, hip hop and trap. Swift described herself as a country artist until the release of ""1989"" (2014), which she characterized as her first ""sonically cohesive pop album"". ""Rolling Stone"" wrote, ""[Swift] might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days."" According to ""The New York Times"", ""There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country—a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar—but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville."" ""The Guardian"" wrote that Swift ""cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory."" Swift's singing voice was described by Sophie Schillaci of ""The Hollywood Reporter"" as ""sweet, but soft"".

1. Medications: Drugs such as corticosteroids, diuretics, and anti-seizure medications can help reduce swelling and pressure in the brain.
2. Decompression surgery: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve pressure on the brain by removing a portion of the skull or inserting a shunt to drain excess fluid.
3. Ventilation support: Patients with severe cerebral edema may require mechanical ventilation to support their breathing.
4. Rehabilitation: After the acute phase of the condition has passed, rehabilitation therapy can help patients regain lost cognitive and motor functions.
It's important to note that the treatment of cerebral edema is highly individualized and depends on the specific cause and severity of the condition, as well as the patient's overall health. A healthcare professional should always be consulted for proper diagnosis and treatment.
